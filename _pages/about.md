<i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> My research focuses on the development of statistical methods and algorithms to analyze complex systems, with a particular interest in network inference. Currently, I am working on the MOMA (Multiscale network modelling of migration flows in Austria) project together with Prof. [Tiago P. Peixoto](https://skewed.de/tiago/) and Prof. [Márton Karsai](https://www.martonkarsai.com/).

<i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-graduation-cap"></i> I completed a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de) and the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de), supervised by [Dr. Caterina De Bacco](https://www.cdebacco.com), with a doctoral dissertation entitled "Probabilistic Generative Models for Inference on Complex Systems". My Ph.D. has been supported by the [Cyber Valley](https://cyber-valley.de/en) and the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems ([IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/)). I also hold a master's degree in Data Science and a bachelor's degree in Statistics for Business and Economics, both from the [University of Padua](https://www.unipd.it/en/).
